 Todd Tian, Purna

Model 1: Base Model essentially naive classification: Runtime ~15 minutes

Model 2, Model 3: Implement more layers and introduce image augmentation: Runtime ~30 Minutes

Model 4: Uses more data augmentation, increase in epochs, and kernal constraints: Runtime 5-6 hours

Model 5: Uses MobileNetV2 which introduces efficient dropout function, average global pooling, increase in layers but optimizes on filtering out useless features.
Introduces batch normalization, padding, and depthwise convolution2D. (All explained in PPT)

Test on animal sets, stress "trick" tests using the pokemon butterfree as a butterfly, a narwhal, and a human.
